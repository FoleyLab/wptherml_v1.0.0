Pioneering the design of materials for harnessing heat.

## Overview
WPTherml stands for **W**illiam **P**aterson University's tool for **Th**ermal **E**nergy and **R**adiation management with **M**ulti **L**ayer nanostructures.
The vision of this software package is to provide an easy-to-use platform for the design of materials with tailored optical and thermal properties for
the vast number of energy applications where control of absorption and emission of radiation, or conversion of heat to radiation or vice versa, is paramount.
The optical properties are treated within classical electrodynamics, and the current version uses the Transfer Matrix Method to rigorously solve Maxwell's equations
for layered isotropic media.  WPTherml was conceived and developed by the [Foley Lab](https://foleylab.github.io) at William Paterson University.

## Quick Start
- WPTherml is written in Python 3 and requires the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib packages.  Current installation of the Anaconda Python 3 package should provide all you need 
on Windows, Mac, or Linux platforms
- To install from github: 
   * `git clone https://github.com/FoleyLab/wptherml.git`
   * `cd wptherml`
   * `python3 setup.py install`

- To run unit tests from cloned repository:
   * `cd test`
   * `python3 -m pytest test.py`

- The test script for running unit tests can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/FoleyLab/wptherml/blob/master/test/test.py)
   
- To install with pip3:
   * `pip3 install wptherml`


- Open a new .py file in your favorite text editor or IDE, e.g.

`vim example.py`

The capabilities of this package are contained within a class called multilayer.  A basic example 
of a script that imports the multilayer class, computes the reflectivity of 20 nm gold film coated with 50 nm of 
TiO2 and 100 nm SiO2, and plots
it using pyplot follows:

```python
from wptherml.wpml import multilayer
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

### dictionary that stores basic properties 
### of the multilayer structure you want to simulate
structure = {
        ### actual materials the structure is made from... note terminal layers are air and
   	### top-side layer (layer upon which light is incident) is SiO2.
        ### Refractive index values are stored in the attribute self.n
        'Material_List': ['Air', 'SiO2', 'TiO2', 'Au', 'Air'],
        ### thickness of each layer... terminal layers must be set to zero
        ### values are stored in attribute self.d
        'Thickness_List': [0, 100e-9, 50e-9, 20e-9,  0],
         ### range of wavelengths optical properties will be calculated for
         ### values are stored in the array self.lam
        'Lambda_List': [400e-9, 800e-9, 1000]
        }

### create the instance called coated_au_film
coated_au_film = multilayer(structure)

### create a plot of the reflectivity of the coated au film - use red lines
### the wavelengths are stored in SI units so we will multiply by 1e9 to 
### plot them in nanometers
plt.plot(1e9*coated_au_film.lambda_array, coated_au_film.reflectivity_array, 'red')
plt.show()
```

- Save this script and run it either in the terminal as

`python3 example.py`

where example.py is the name of the file you created, or if you were doing this in an IDE, execute it within your IDE!

The schematic that illustrates the above example is shown in the figure below. Note the ordering of the 
layers in the picture and how they are specified through Material_List and Thickness_List relative to 
the incident, reflected, transmitted, and thermally-emitted light.

## Podcast
One of the developers co-hosts a light-matter themed [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7hh6eZ3TLxJFwuWnLAXM6L?si=qp-GQc4ZSXGgvbvyYtUi2w) called [The Goeppert Mayer Gauge](https://foleylab.github.io/gmgauge/) along with [Prof. Dugan Hayes](http://www.chm.uri.edu/hayesgroup/) at University of Rhode Island.  

## Features List
1. Computes Reflectivity, Transmissivity, and Absorptivity/Emissivity spectrum of arbitrary multi-layered planar structures using the Transfer Matrix Method
2. Computes Thermal Emission spectrum at a given temperature of multi-layer structure as emissivity * Blackbody spectrum 
3. Computes solar power absorbed from absorptivity * AM1.5 spectrum
4. From the quantities above, the following performance-related quantities can be computed for various thermal-related applications:
   * Spectral Efficiency of (S)TPV Emitters for a given PV
   * Useful Power Density (S)TPV Emitters for a given PV
   * Short Circuit Current Density (S)TPV Emitter for a given PV
   * TPV Efficiency (S)TPV Emitters for a given PV
   * Absorber Efficiency for STPV Absorbers for a given concentration factor
   * Luminous Efficiency/Luminous Efficacy of Incandescent bulb filaments
   * Cooling Power for day-time radiative cooling for a given ambient temperature and temperature of the multi-layer
5. From optical quantities, the following analysis can be performed
   * Identify Surface Plasmon Polariton modes
   * Identify Perfectly Absorbing modes
   * Rendering of color of a multi-layer at cool temperatures and at elevated temperatures

The calculations of the quantities above are facilitated by a class called *multilayer*.  The *multilayer* class parses a dictionary for key 
structural data like the material and thicknesses that comprise the multi-layer structure being modeled, the types of applications one wants to
consider the multi-layer structure for.  The following is the complete list of dictionary keys the *multilayer* class will recognize, along with
the data the user can supply in association with each key:
```python
'Lambda_List' # a list of three floats that includes in order (i) shortest wavelength in meters, (ii) longest wavelength in meters, and (iii) total number of wavelengths where you would like the optical quantities to be evaluated.  (Default is [400e-9,6000e-9,1000])

'Thickness_List' # a list of floats that specify the thickness in meters of each layer.  Note that the terminal layers (first and last) must have thickness of 0. (Default is [0, 900e-9, 0].)

'Material_List' # a list of strings that specify the materials in each layer (Default is ['Air', 'W', 'Air'].  
The following strings are currently recognized for the following supported materials:
   * 'Air' - keyword for Air
   * 'SiO2' - keyword for Glass
   * 'HfO2' - keyword for Hafnium Oxide
   * 'Al2O3' - keyword for Aluminum Oxide
   * 'TiO2' - keyword for Titanium Oxide
   * 'AlN'  - keyword for Aluminum Nitride
   * 'TiN' - keyword for Titanium Nitride
   * 'Ag' - keyword for Silver
   * 'Au' - keyword for Gold
   * 'Pd' - keyword for Palladium
   * 'Pt' - keyword for Platinum
   * 'W' - keyword for Tungsten

'Temperature'  # a float specifying the temperature of the multi-layer structure in Kelvin.  (Default is 300 K)

'PV_Temperature' # a float specifying the temperature of a PV cell in a (S)TPV device in Kelvin.  (Default is 300 K).

'Ambient_Temperature' # a float specifying the ambient temperature in Kelvin for radiative cooling applications. (Default is 300 K).

'STPV_EMIT' # an int where '1' means compute properties associated with (S)TPV emitters. (Default is 0, do not compute these quantities).

'STPV_ABS' # an int where '1' means compute properties associated with STPV/Concentrated Solar absorbers. (Default is 0).

'COOLING' # an int where '1' means compute properties associated with radiative cooling. (Default is 0).

'LIGHTBULB' # an int where '1' means compute properties associated with incandescent sources. (Default is 0).

'COLOR' # an int where '1' means compute and display the ambient and thermal color of a structure. (Default is 0).

'EXPLICIT_ANGLE' # an int where '1' means compute the optical properties and thermal emission at a range of angles and, when applicable, compute performance properties with explicit angular dependence.  (Default is 0, meaning most quantities will be computed assuming the emissivity does not depend upon angle.)

'DEG' # an int that specifies the number of different angles that will be considered 
in the calculation of optical and thermal emission properties as a function of angle. (Default is 7, which has been observed to give reasonably good accuracy when all angular integrals are performed using Gauss-Legendre quadrature).

## Method and attribute list for multilayer class
Given the input parameters specified above, the *multilayer* class uses different methods to compute properties relevant for thermal applications, and those properties are stored as attributes
of the *multilayer* object.  The following is a list of methods of the *multilayer* class and their related attributes:


```python
	def inline_structure(structure):
       	### a method to parse input parameters from a dictionary (here called structure, all currently-supported dictionary 
       	### keys are defined above.  This method is called by the __init__ and defines the following attributes:

	self.lambda_array 	# the list of wavelengths in meters that will be used to evaluate optical and thermal spectra
	self.d		  	# the list of thicknesses that define the geometry of the multilayer
	self.matlist      	# the list of strings that specify the materials
	self.n		  	# the 2D arrays of refractive index values for each material for each wavelength (inner index specifies material, outter index wavelength)
	self.T_ml         	# the temperature of the multi-layer in Kelvin
	self.T_cell       	# the temperature of the PV cell in Kelvin
	self.T_amb      	# the ambient temperature in Kelvin
	self.stpv_emitter_calc  # the flag that determines if (S)TPV emitter properties will be computed
	self.stpv_absorber_calc # the flag that determines if (S)TPV absorber properties will be computed
	self.cooling_calc    	# the flag that determines if radiative cooling properties will be computed
	self.lightbulb_calc     # the flag that determines if incandescent properties will be computed
	self.color_calc 	# the flag that determines if colors will be rendered
	self.explicit_angle 	# the flag that determines if explicit angle-dependence of optical properties will be considered
	self.deg		# the number of different angles that will be computed for angle-dependent optical properties
  ```
{: .language-python}
In addition to the attributes that are explicitly set by parsing user input, several more attributes that are arrays will be 
allocated based on attributes defined by inline_structure:
```python
	### The following are always created
	self.reflectivity_array 	# initialized as an array of zeros the same length as self.lambda_array
	self.transmissivity_array	# initialized as an array of zeros the same length as self.lambda_array

	### The following are created if self.explicit_angle == 1
	self.x				# points from Gauss-Legendre grid of degree self.deg from 0 to 1
	self.t				# self.deg angles on Gauss-Legendre grid transformed to be between 0 and pi/2
	self.w				# self.deg weights from Gauss-Legendre grid transformed to be between 0 and pi/2

	self.reflectivity_array_p       # initialized as a 2D array of zeros, inner dimension same as self.deg and outter same as self.lambda_array
        self.reflectivity_array_s       # initialized as a 2D array of zeros, inner dimension same as self.deg and outter same as self.lambda_array

        self.thermal_emission_array_s   # initialized as a 2D array of zeros, inner dimension same as self.deg and outter same as self.lambda_array

## Extending the multilayer class

The multilayer class should provide a convenient mechanism for extension of the package to include 
additional applications (which might require different manipulations of the Fresnel 
quantities stored as the attributes self.reflectivity_array, self.emissivity_array, 
self.transmissivity_array, or the thermal emission stored as the attribute 
self.thermal_emission_array), or to include different classes of structures 
(non-planar structures, for example, where the same attributes self.reflectivity_array, etc., 
would be computed by a different method than the transfer matrix method).  The typical 
workflow to extend the capabilities of the package could include

- Identifying any new properties that will be computed by the 
extension and adding appropriate attributes to the multilayer class
- Adding one or more functions to the libraries (stpvlib, etc.) 
that manipulates the Fresnel and/or thermal emission quantites as 
required to compute the new desired property
- Adding one or more multilayer methods to call the new library functions 
and store the resulting data in new or existing multilayer attributes as appropriate.
